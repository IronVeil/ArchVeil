# IronVeil's Arch Installer
This script will install a version of Arch Linux onto your system. I created this mainly since I am lazy and reinstalling Arch is tedious. It also allows me to condense all my tweaks and tricks to auto install, saving some time and ensuring that I don't miss any.

`config.sh` generates a `settings.sh` script. I am planning on adding a few example scripts, mainly for my PC and laptop. I will also expand this script with new features, tweaks and more.
